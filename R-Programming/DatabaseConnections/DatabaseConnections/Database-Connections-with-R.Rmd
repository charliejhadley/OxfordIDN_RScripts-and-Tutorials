# Machine Dependent

These instructions are highly machine dependent.

In general, using `RODBC` is recommended but is dependent on a number of system settings.

# "ODBC headers sql.h and sqlext.h not found"

Error discovered when installing `RODBC`

I found this: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/209676388-Successfully-solved-R-Studio-for-mac-can-not-support-RODBC

I complimented that with this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/37993728/1659890

1. brew install unixodbc
1. brew link unixodbc (if missing this step, R still can not find those header files)
1. install.packages('RODBC', type='source')

# MySQL

I used homebrew for mysql: https://gist.github.com/nrollr/a8d156206fa1e53c6cd6
